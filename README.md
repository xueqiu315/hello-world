# hello-world
My first repository. I am learning from GitHub tutorial.
I am learning data science and doing projects now.
I have learned the following:
  Created an open source repository
  Started and managed a new branch
  Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub (The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.)
  Opened and merged a Pull Request
